### Day 1:July 13, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Set up git repos for project and this one. did basic code to pull down tweets from twitter API. Will try to filter twitter api data tomorrow and be able to break it down.

**Thoughts:**: Long way to go, but at least first day is done.

### Day 2:July 14, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time working through process json data and understanding how to reference items in the data by using dictionary entries. Not a lot of actual saved code. Lots of reading and playing today to understand how it works. Set up basic kinesis stream to feed data into.

**Thoughts:**: being able to predictably access data out of what comes back from twitter api makes things easy. dictionaries are good for looking up data. Pushing tweets into a kinesis steam is particularly easy... consuming it may not be quite so easy

### Day 3:July 15, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Played Around with kenesis stream consumer that then fed the text of the tweets through AWS comprehend to do sentiment analysis. Super easy to use... really cool. Also learned what keyword arguments only means. Handy to know.

**Thoughts:**: Life sometimes makes it challenging to set aside time. Heopfully that will get easier as the habit forms... having an 8 month old however means late evenings are typically it for me. Need to work on making sure I am ready to go.

### Day 4:July 16, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**:  Wrote python to create Kinesis Stream so that I can create it at the beginning of hte day to cut my AWS costs while I am playing - Put it basic checking to make sure a stream with that name doesn't already exist. Also created deletion script.

**Thoughts:**:  It was interesting to read that [-1:] would return the last value of a list, and that if it was an empty list it would return an empty value rather than an exception. However meant that it was returning a list object rather than the string element. This took me a while to figure out that it was the : causing that.
