# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1:July 13, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Set up git repos for project and this one. did basic code to pull down tweets from twitter API. Will try to filter twitter api data tomorrow and be able to break it down.

**Thoughts:**: Long way to go, but at least first day is done.

### Day 2:July 14, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time working through process json data and understanding how to reference items in the data by using dictionary entries. Not a lot of actual saved code. Lots of reading and playing today to understand how it works. Set up basic kinesis stream to feed data into.

**Thoughts:**: being able to predictably access data out of what comes back from twitter api makes things easy. dictionaries are good for looking up data. Pushing tweets into a kinesis steam is particularly easy... consuming it may not be quite so easy
